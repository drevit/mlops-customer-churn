# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of the ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity


## Project Description
The project is a use case for clean coding principles like unit testing and logging. The use case is the prediction of churn on a dataset that contains information about the clients of a bank institution.

## Running Files
In order to handle dependencies and to run the project on the most recent python version available at date (3.12), the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) packaging and dependency manager has been used. Information on how to use and install Poetry can be found [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

After installing python 3.12 and poetry, all the libraries required to run the repository (listed in `pyproject.toml`) can be installed with 

```
cd mlops-customer-churn
poetry install
```

This will create a dedicated virtual environment for the project. 

In order to run the churn_library.py script:
```
poetry run python churn_library.py
```

## Unit Tests
Tests are defined in the test_churn_library.py and can be executed using poetry and pytest:
```
poetry run pytest
```
